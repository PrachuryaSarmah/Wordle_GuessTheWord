# Wordle_GuessTheWord
This Wordle project is the clone of the famous Wordle Game where we need to guess the correct word in 6 attempts. 
In each attempt whenever we write our guess, the letters are coloured as green(indicating the correct positioning of letter in the word), 
yellow (indicating that the letter is present in the answer word but not at the correct position) 
and grey(indicating that the letter is not present in the answer word). 
This project has been made using ReactJS and data is fetched from the JSON server- the database created manually in the project itself. 
Guess the word now!
